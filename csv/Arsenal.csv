19,Axe of the Dwarvish Lords,,1d8,slashing,3,1d8,slashing,thrown,,20/60,1d10,,2,,Poison,"Adv. on poisoned saves, Speak Dwarvish",,,,,Summon / Teleport / Fabricate,Conjure Earth Elemental|Travel the Depths|Fabricate,"Magic Thrown Weapon. The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. 
When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.

Sharpened Edge. When you attack an object with this magic battleaxe and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.
When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the DM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

Light Emission. Speak the battleaxe's command to cause it to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the weapon puts out the light.

Item of Dwarvenkind. While you have this weapon, you gain the following benefits:
Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.
You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with dwarves.

In addition, while attuned to it, you have a 50 percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard if you're capable of growing one, or a visibly thicker beard if you already have one.

If you aren't a dwarf, you gain the following additional benefits while you have this weapon:
You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.
You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish.

Curse. The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell.

Destroying the Axe. The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.

Random Properties. The axe has the following randomly determined properties, based on these d100 dice rolls: 10, 94, 60, 52, 8
